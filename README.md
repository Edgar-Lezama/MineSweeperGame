# MineSweeperGame
This project recreates the classic Mind Sweeper game in a window. Left click selects a cell, ctrl + left click flags a cell, alt + left click unflags a cell.

This project started as a final exam project that I (irresponsibly) lost.
This is my attempt to recreate it.

!!IMPORTANT!!
This code is currently a work in progress. I am having issues generating the bombs correctly
and the proximty numbering class still needs to be tweaked.
